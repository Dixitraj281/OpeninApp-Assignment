# project_overview
This React web application implements a dashboard-style interface with several components for navigation, overview, and transaction details.

## Components Overview
### Sidebar
The Sidebar component creates a fixed sidebar with a collapsible menu. It includes a logo, the application name ("Dukaan"), a link to visit the store, and information about available credits. The sidebar can be expanded or collapsed using ChevronUp and ChevronDown icons.

### Navbar
The Navbar component represents the top navigation bar with links for "Payout," a help icon with the text "How it works," and a search input field. Icons for a user group and a menu are also included.

### Home Page
The Table component displays an overview section with information about next payouts, amounts pending, and amounts processed. It also includes a table with transaction details for the current month.

## Dependencies
1. React.js
2. Lucide Icons Library

## Styling
Styling is achieved using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework and external css files.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
